# FFWizard
This project uses PyQt5 in order to help you best prepare for fantasy football.

## Usage
Navigate to the src directory and run `python main.py`. Everything from that point on should be self explanatory (if you play fantasy football)

## Required Packages
- PyQt5

## Notes
This is an app in continuous development. Future plans include using a database to store information about the players, adding a value over replacement field, adding a watch list, etc. The current statistics represent data from before the start of the regular season for the 2020-2021 NFL season.
