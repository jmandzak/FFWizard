# FFWizard
This project uses PyQt5 in order to help you best prepare for fantasy football.

## Usage
### Non-Software Engineers
### (Note: Currently broken for mac)
1. Locate the releases button on the right hand side of the github screen and click it. If you are on a windows machine, download FFWizard.zip. If you are on Mac or Linux, download FFWizardUnix.zip.
2. Extract the zip file, then go into the FFWizard folder.
3. Look for either FFWizard or FFWizardUnix file (depending on which you downloaded) and double click the file.
4. That's it! If it doesn't work for you, feel free to email me at the email listed below.

### If you prefer to run the code directly
Navigate to the src directory and run `python main.py`. Everything from that point on should be self explanatory (if you play fantasy football)

## Required Packages (only necessary if not using the zip file)
- PyQt5
- Pandas

## Known Bugs
These are bugs that either haven't been important enough to fix, or I just haven't gotten around to fixing yet.
- Hitting draft or remove player when no player is selected from list causes crash.
- Drafting a player from queue causes crash.

## Notes
This is an app in continuous development. Future plans include using a database to store information about the players, adding a value over replacement field, etc. The current statistics represent data from before the start of the regular season for the 2022-2023 NFL season.
